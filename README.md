# DRYCLEANINGAPP
Hello, 
I would like to try and have some of you get together to build an app to make it easier to deliver drycleaning but with a twist. A different business model with a problem and needs a solution.

-Instead of an app for: Jon Doe ownes a drycleaning store, and uses an app to help with deliveries. (most prevalent amongst apps available.) 

-Idea (In lamens terms for lack of a better term): An App. More than ever people do stuff online. I want people to be able to have the best experience from pick up to delivery and a nice surprise when they get their clothes back from the drycleaners, "The spots GONE!!" In fact I want it to be expected and consistant.  So I want the client to know we choose a network of only the best drycleaners for them, so they dont have to. In short, I come up with a rigorous quality spot check and cleaning process for all drycleaner members of the network, to follow.  If they comply, I open the option of new online clients. 

-Problem: The business model. We offer numerous services, from shoe repair to textil repairs and adjustments working with only the best of these established services around the the clients local area. Becuause of the way things are setup in the country I reside in, adding a Van and an employee isnÂ´t feasable primarily because cost, so a service of this nature would help with local business. We do the marketing which converts to cusotmers for them, provide the van the employee and the app, all they do is conduct their business according to a high quality standard consistant throughout the network. 

Ideas on how to make this project more attractive are welcome.
The app would look something like this: www.Starchup.com
